Basic Data Structure Interview Questions for Freshers

<----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

1. What are Data Structures?
A data structure is a mechanical or logical way that data is organized within a program.
The organization of data is what determines how a program performs.
There are many types of data structures, each with its own uses.
When designing code, we need to pay particular attention to the way data is structured.
If data isn't stored efficiently or correctly structured, then the overall performance of the code will be reduced.

2. Why Create Data Structures?
Data structures serve a number of important functions in a program.
They ensure that each line of code performs its function correctly and efficiently,
they help the programmer identify and fix problems with his/her code, and they help to create a clear and organized code base.

3. What are some applications of Data structures?
Decision Making
Genetics
Image Processing
Blockchain
Numerical and Statistical Analysis
Compiler Design
Database Design and many more

4. Explain the process behind storing a variable in memory.
A variable is stored in memory based on the amount of memory that is needed. Following are the steps followed to store a variable:
(1) The required amount of memory is assigned first.
(2) Then, it is stored based on the data structure being used.
Using concepts like dynamic allocation ensures high efficiency and that the storage units can be accessed based on requirements in real-time.

5. Can you explain the difference between file structure and storage structure?
File Structure: Representation of data into secondary or auxiliary memory say any device such as a hard disk or pen drives that stores data
which remains intact until manually deleted is known as a file structure representation.
Storage Structure: In this type, data is stored in the main memory i.e RAM, and is deleted once the function that uses this data gets completely executed.
The difference is that the storage structure has data stored in the memory of the computer system, 
whereas the file structure has the data stored in the auxiliary memory.
